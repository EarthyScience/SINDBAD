    getIndicesSplit(info, sites, fold_type)

Determine the indices for training, validation, and testing site splits for hybrid (ML) modeling in SINDBAD.

This function dispatches on the `fold_type` argument to either load precomputed folds from file or to compute the splits on-the-fly based on the provided split ratios and number of folds.

# Arguments
- `info`: The SINDBAD experiment info structure, containing hybrid modeling configuration.
- `sites`: Array of site identifiers (e.g., site names or indices).
- `fold_type`: Determines the splitting strategy. Use `LoadFoldFromFile()` to load folds from file, or `CalcFoldFromSplit()` to compute splits dynamically.

# Returns
- `indices_training`: Indices of sites assigned to the training set.
- `indices_validation`: Indices of sites assigned to the validation set.
- `indices_testing`: Indices of sites assigned to the testing set.

# Notes
- When using `LoadFoldFromFile`, the function loads fold indices from the file specified in `info.hybrid.fold.fold_path`.
- When using `CalcFoldFromSplit`, the function splits the sites according to the ratios and number of folds specified in `info.hybrid.ml_training.options`.
- Ensures reproducibility by using the random seed from `info.hybrid.random_seed` when shuffling sites.

# Example
```julia
indices_train, indices_val, indices_test = getIndicesSplit(info, sites, info.hybrid.fold.fold_type)

Partition a list of sites into training, validation, and testing sets for k-fold cross-validation in hybrid (ML) modeling.

This function shuffles the input `sites` array using the provided random `seed` for reproducibility, then splits the sites into `n_folds` folds. It computes the number of sites for each partition based on the provided ratios, ensuring the training set size is a multiple of `batch_size`. The function returns the indices for training, validation, and testing sets, as well as the full list of folds.

# Arguments
- `sites`: Array of site identifiers (e.g., site names or indices).
- `train_ratio`: Fraction of sites to assign to the training set.
- `val_ratio`: Fraction of sites to assign to the validation set.
- `test_ratio`: Fraction of sites to assign to the testing set.
- `n_folds`: Number of folds for cross-validation.
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training; training set size will be rounded down to a multiple of this value.
- `seed`: (Optional) Random seed for reproducibility (default: 1234).

# Returns
- `train_indices`: Array of sites assigned to the training set.
- `val_indices`: Array of sites assigned to the validation set.
- `test_indices`: Array of sites assigned to the testing set.
- `folds`: Vector of arrays, each containing the sites for one fold.

# Notes
- The sum of `train_ratio`, `val_ratio`, and `test_ratio` must be approximately 1.0.
- The returned `folds` can be used for further cross-validation or analysis.

"""
    getLossFunctionHandles(info, run_helpers, sites)

Construct loss function handles for each site for use in hybrid (ML) modeling in SINDBAD.

This function generates callable loss functions and loss component functions for each site, encapsulating all necessary arguments and configuration from the experiment `info` and runtime helpers. These handles are used during training and evaluation to compute the loss and its components for each site efficiently.

# Arguments
- `info`: The SINDBAD experiment info structure, containing model, optimization, and hybrid configuration.
- `run_helpers`: Helper object returned by `prepTEM`, containing prepared model, forcing, observation, and output structures.
- `sites`: Array of site indices or identifiers for which to build loss functions.

# Returns
- `loss_functions`: A `KeyedArray` of callable loss functions, one per site. Each function takes model parameters as input and returns the scalar loss for that site.
- `loss_component_functions`: A `KeyedArray` of callable functions, one per site, that return the vector of loss components (e.g., for multi-objective or constraint-based loss).

# Notes
- Each loss function is closed over all required data and options for its site, including model structure, parameter indices, scaling, forcing, observations, output cache, cost options, and hybrid/optimization settings.
- The returned arrays are keyed by site for convenient lookup and iteration.

# Example
```julia
loss_functions, loss_component_functions = getLossFunctionHandles(info, run_helpers, sites)
site_loss = loss_functions[site_index](params)
site_loss_components = loss_component_functions[site_index](params)
