# SINDBAD Repository

-   SINDBAD is **not an open source modeling framework**, and it is
    available only to the members of the Department of Biogeochemical
    Integration at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena,
    Germany.

-   SINDBAD is hosted in the git repository system (gitLab) of the
    MPI-BGC at

    -   <https://git.bgc-jena.mpg.de/sindbad/sindbad>

-   In case you do not have a gitLab account, contact
    git@bgc-jena.mpg.de to register for an account.

-   For access to the SINDBAD repository, contact either Sujan Koirala
    (<skoirala@bgc-jena.mpg.de>), Martin Jung (<mjung@bgc-jena.mpg.de>),
    or Nuno Carvalhais (<ncarval@bgc-jena.mpg.de>).

# First Steps
Once there is an access to the repository, **everyone (users and
developers) should create a development branch from the master. The
branch should have a unique and logical name associated with the project
or a person.**

-   The SINDBAD code under development should only be pushed to each
    **person/project's own development branch**.

-   Once the development has been tested thoroughly, a merge request to
    the master branch should be created.

    -   Merge requests to the master branch will be handled by masters
        of the repository.

-   Any one, who is new to git is highly recommended to go through the
    basic tutorials.

    -   An example of a good tutorial is at
        <https://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/learn-git-in-30-minutes>

    -   In some cases, beginner's tutorial course for git is provided by
        Fabian Gans (<fgans@bgc-jena.mpg.de>) and/or Thomas Wutzler
        (<twutz@bgc-jena.mpg.de>) at the BGI department. Check the
        presentations in the following directory and contact them
        directly for further possibilities.

# Software Recommendations
Following are some recommendations for editor and git softwares.

-   Command line with gitHub desktop (free)

-   gitKraken (commercial or free for 12 months for github students
        account)

-   Sourcetree (proprietary)

-   The integrated development editor 'atom', which is available for
        all operating systems.

    -   Can be downloaded from <https://atom.io>.

    -   Atom provides inbuilt git integration. There are several
            tutorials for git integration in atom. The example below is
            recommended because\.... ;-)
