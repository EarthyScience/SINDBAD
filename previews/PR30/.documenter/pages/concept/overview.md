SINDBAD is a framework for seamlessly integrating ecosystem models with multiple data streams through various optimization schemes and integration methods. The framework treats input data, initial conditions, parameters, model processes, observations, and integration methods as interconnected components of a unified system, as illustrated in the figure below.

## Framework Flexibility {#Framework-Flexibility}

SINDBAD achieves its flexibility through modular design in four key areas:
1. **Model Structure**: Adaptable ecosystem process representations
  
2. **Input Data**: Flexible data ingestion and processing
  
3. **Observation Data**: Versatile observational constraint integration
  
4. **Integration Methods**: Customizable optimization and assimilation approaches
  

## Configuration and Implementation {#Configuration-and-Implementation}

All framework options and approaches are specified through configuration files, ensuring consistent information storage across SINDBAD objects and structures. This standardization enables models to process information uniformly regardless of the specific configuration.

## Core Components {#Core-Components}

The SINDBAD workflow consists of the following key steps:
1. **Configuration**
  - Read and process [configuration files](../settings/overview.md)
    
  - Set up [experiment information](info.md)
    - Configure [model structure and pools](TEM.md)
      
    - Define [simulation parameters](experiment.md)
      
    
  
2. **Data Processing**
  - Load [forcing](../settings/forcing.md) and [observation](../settings/optimization.md) data using [SindbadData](../code/data.md)
    
  - Prepare model initial setups using [SindbadSetup](../code/setup.md)
    
  - Configure [optimization settings](../settings/optimization.md)
    
  
3. **Execution**
  - [Run the experiment](../develop/experiments.md)
