## EO-LINCS (2024-) {#EO-LINCS-2024-}

::: info about

Under ESA Carbon Science Cluster: Research Opportunities 2 – Theme 2: Carbon Data Enquiry And Benchmarking, the EO-LINCS (Earth Observation, Local and Integrated data eNquiry for Terrestrial Carbon Science) promotes a community effort towards an enhanced multi-mission assessment of the terrestrial carbon cycle at resolutions in space and time compatible with decision making by improving the access to the Earth Observation (EO) data for the wider carbon scientific community so that key questions related to scale, representativeness, consistency, reliability, as well as the applicability of the multivariate EO data and how they affect our understanding of the carbon cycle processes across spatial and temporal scales can be addressed.
