    generateApproachCode(model_name, appr_name, appr_purpose, n_parameters; methods=(:define, :precompute, :compute, :update))

Generate the code template for a SINDBAD approach. 
    
# Description
The `generateApproachCode` function creates a code template for a SINDBAD approach. It defines the structure, parameters, methods, and documentation for the approach, ensuring consistency with the SINDBAD framework. The generated code includes placeholders for methods (`define`, `precompute`, `compute`, `update`) and automatically generates a docstring for the approach.

# Arguments
- `model_name`: The name of the SINDBAD model to which the approach belongs.
- `appr_name`: The name of the approach to be generated.
- `appr_purpose`: A string describing the purpose of the approach.
- `n_parameters`: The number of parameters required by the approach.
- `methods`: A tuple of method names to include in the approach (default: `(:define, :precompute, :compute, :update)`).

# Returns
- A string containing the generated code template for the approach.

# Behavior
- If `n_parameters` is greater than 0, the function generates a parameterized structure for the approach, including default values and metadata for each parameter.
- For each method in `methods`, the function generates a placeholder implementation with comments and instructions for customization.
- The function also generates a purpose definition and a docstring for the approach, including placeholders for extended help, references, and versioning.

# Example
```julia
# Generate code for an approach with 2 parameters
approach_code = generateApproachCode(:ambientCO2, :ambientCO2_constant, "sets ambient_CO2 as a constant", 2)

println(approach_code)
```

Generate the code template for a SINDBAD model.

# Description
The `generateModelCode` function creates a code template for a SINDBAD model. It defines the model's structure, purpose, and includes all associated approaches. The generated code ensures consistency with the SINDBAD framework and provides a standardized starting point for defining new models.

# Arguments
- `model_name`: The name of the SINDBAD model to be generated.
- `model_purpose`: A string describing the purpose of the model.

# Returns
- A string containing the generated code template for the model.

# Behavior
- Defines the model as an abstract type that inherits from `LandEcosystem`.
- Sets the purpose of the model using the `purpose` function.
- Includes all approaches associated with the model using the `includeApproaches` function.
- Generates a placeholder docstring for the model, including a reference to `\$(getModelDocString)`.

# Example
```julia
# Generate code for a SINDBAD model
model_code = generateModelCode(:ambientCO2, "Represents the ambient CO2 concentration in the ecosystem.")

println(model_code)
```

    generateSindbadApproach(model_name::Symbol, model_purpose::String, appr_name::Symbol, appr_purpose::String, n_parameters::Int; methods=(:define, :precompute, :compute, :update), force_over_write=:none)

Generate a SINDBAD model and/or approach with code templates.

**Due to risk of overwriting code, the function only succeeds if y|Y||Yes|Ya, etc., are given in the confirmation prompt. This function only works if the call is copy-pasted into the REPL and not evaluated from a file/line. See the example below for the syntax.**

# Description
The `generateSindbadApproach` function creates a SINDBAD model and/or approach by generating code templates for their structure, parameters, methods, and documentation. It ensures consistency with the SINDBAD framework and adheres to naming conventions. If the model or approach already exists, it avoids overwriting existing files unless explicitly permitted. The generated code includes placeholders for methods (`define`, `precompute`, `compute`, `update`) and automatically generates docstrings for the model and approach. 
    
*Note that the newly created approaches are tracked by changes in `tmp_precompile_placeholder.jl` in the Sindbad root. The new models/approaches are automatically included ONLY when REPL is restarted.*

# Arguments
- `model_name`: The name of the SINDBAD model to which the approach belongs.
- `model_purpose`: A string describing the purpose of the model.
- `appr_name`: The name of the approach to be generated.
- `appr_purpose`: A string describing the purpose of the approach.
- `n_parameters`: The number of parameters required by the approach.
- `methods`: A tuple of method names to include in the approach (default: `(:define, :precompute, :compute, :update)`).
- `force_over_write`: A symbol indicating whether to overwrite existing files or types. Options are:
  - `:none` (default): Do not overwrite existing files or types.
  - `:model`: Overwrite the model file and type.
  - `:approach`: Overwrite the approach file and type.
  - `:both`: Overwrite both model and approach files and types.

# Returns
- `nothing`: The function generates the required files and writes them to the appropriate directory.

# Behavior
- If the model does not exist, it generates a new model file with the specified `model_name` and `model_purpose`.
- If the approach does not exist, it generates a new approach file with the specified `appr_name`, `appr_purpose`, and `n_parameters`.
- Ensures that the approach name follows the SINDBAD naming convention (`<model_name>_<approach_name>`).
- Prompts the user for confirmation before generating files to avoid accidental overwrites.
- Includes placeholders for methods (`define`, `precompute`, `compute`, `update`) and generates a consistent docstring for the approach.

# Example
```julia
# Generate a new SINDBAD approach for an existing model

generateSindbadApproach(:ambientCO2, "Represents ambient CO2 concentration", :constant, "Sets ambient CO2 as a constant", 1)

# Generate a new SINDBAD model and approach

generateSindbadApproach(:newModel, "Represents a new SINDBAD model", :newApproach, "Implements a new approach for the model", 2)

# Generate a SINDBAD model and approach with force_over_write

generateSindbadApproach(:newModel, "Represents a new SINDBAD model", :newApproach, "Implements a new approach for the model", 2; force_over_write=:both) # overwrite both model and approach

generateSindbadApproach(:newModel, "Represents a new SINDBAD model", :newApproach, "Implements a new approach for the model", 2; force_over_write=:approach) # overwrite just approach approach
```
# Notes
- The function ensures that the generated code adheres to SINDBAD conventions and includes all necessary metadata and documentation.
- If the model or approach already exists, the function does not overwrite the files unless explicitly confirmed by the user.
- The function provides warnings and prompts to ensure safe file generation and minimize the risk of accidental overwrites.
