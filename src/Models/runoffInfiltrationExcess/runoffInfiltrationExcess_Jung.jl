# compute:
Infiltration excess runoff using runoffInfiltrationExcess_Jung

*Inputs*
 - land.rainIntensity.rainInt: rain intensity [mm/h]
 - land.rainSnow.rain : rainfall [mm/time]
 - land.soilWBase.kSat: infiltration capacity [mm/day]
 - land.states.fAPAR: fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation  (equivalent to "canopy cover" in Gash & Miralles)

*Outputs*
 - land.fluxes.runoffInfiltration: infiltration excess runoff [mm/time] - what runs off because  the precipitation intensity is to high for it to inflitrate in  the soil

 - 1.0 on 18.11.2019 [ttraut]: cleaned up the code
 - 1.1 on 22.11.2019 [skoirala]: moved from prec to dyna to handle land.states.fAPAR which is nPix, 1
