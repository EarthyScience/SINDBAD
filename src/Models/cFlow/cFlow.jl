Actual transfers of c between pools (of diagonal components)

# Approaches:
 - CASA: combine all the effects that change the transfers between carbon pools
 - GSI: Precomputations for the transfers between carbon pools based on GSI method. combine all the effects that change the transfers between carbon pools based on GSI method
 - none: set transfer between pools to 0 [i.e. nothing is transfered] set giver & taker matrices to [] get the transfer matrix transfers
 - simple: combine all the effects that change the transfers between carbon pools
