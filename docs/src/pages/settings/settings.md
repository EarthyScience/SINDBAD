## SINDBAD Configuration 

The SINDBAD model structure and simulations are defined by a set of **configuration files written in the .json format**. All the configuration files for a given experiment should be saved inside a separate directory within the **settings** directory of the SINDBAD root. An example of a set of configuration files is in settings/cCycle\_debug directory of root SINDBAD directory. While developing, it is recommended to change the names of the configuration files, so that the they can be easily associated with the respective experiment, and to keep the experiment setup traceable and reproducible.
