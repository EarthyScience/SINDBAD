## Params

Optionally, SINDBAD allows for model runs using parameters that are different from default parameter values that are defined within each model.

The main purpose of this functionality is to do a forward run of the model using a set of optimized parameters that are output from SINDBAD optimization experiment.

Note that the parameters are set from a ```csv``` file rather than ```json``` for all the other settings. This is set under ```basics/config_files``` in ```experiment.json``` as,
````json
"params": "parameterfile.csv",
````

An example content of such parameter file is,
```csv
model_id,name,default,optim,lower,upper,model,model_approach,approach_func,name_full,dist,p_dist,is_ml
9,constant_frac_max_root_depth,0.64153683,0.17584273,0.1,0.8,rootMaximumDepth,rootMaximumDepth_fracSoilD,rootMaximumDepth_fracSoilD,rootMaximumDepth.constant_frac_max_root_depth,normal,"Float32[0.0, 1.0]",false
10,k_efficiency_cVegRoot,0.20278321,0.156937,0.001,0.3,rootWaterEfficiency,rootWaterEfficiency_expCvegRoot,rootWaterEfficiency_expCvegRoot,rootWaterEfficiency.k_efficiency_cVegRoot,normal,"Float32[0.0, 1.0]",false
11,k_extinction,0.040267758,0.0207451,0.0005,0.05,fAPAR,fAPAR_cVegLeaf,fAPAR_cVegLeaf,fAPAR.k_extinction,normal,"Float32[0.0, 1.0]",false
13,constant_frac_tree,0.94845194,0.7794514,0.3,1.0,treeFraction,treeFraction_constant,treeFraction_constant,treeFraction.constant_frac_tree,normal,"Float32[0.0, 1.0]",false
15,melt_T,3.3035417,4.3586965,0.01,10.0,snowMelt,snowMelt_TairRn,snowMelt_TairRn,snowMelt.melt_T,normal,"Float32[0.0, 1.0]",false
```

As seen, the content of file is generated by the SINDBAD output processor. It is recommended that parameter file is not generated manually to avoid parsing issues.
