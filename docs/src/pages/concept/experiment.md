# SINDBAD Experiment

A SINDBAD experiment represents a scientific or modeling task that involves:

- Designing a model structure.
- Configuring and running model simulations.
- Using observations to invert parameters or evaluate model performance.
- Evaluating model simulations to improve our understanding of ecosystem processes


## Key Concepts:
Experimental design are guided by the following aspects:

- `Independence`: Each experiment is independent, enabling standalone research while maintaining an interface for knowledge sharing.
- `Flexibility`: Experiments can utilize various SINDBAD components, such as core models from base packages or optimization tools from SindbadOptimization.
- `Extensibility`: Experiments can incorporate external packages and methods, allowing for tool expansion and development.
- `Integration`: Completed experiments should ideally contribute their tools and findings back to the core SINDBAD framework.
